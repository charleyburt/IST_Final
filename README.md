# IST_Final


 Authors: Charley Burtwistle, Chase Stone, Brian Spencer

 Project: Final Project (Gremlins and twinkies)


The output of your program should be a list of the hexes Spike must traverse,
in order, to get to the Twinkies in the most efficient manner.
If there is more than one route with equally minimal cost,
simply output one. If there is no path to the Twinkies at all,
output an empty list.


Notes:
 - Had to add a DecreaseKey Method to our MinHeap.h file in order to
   change the priority of an element in the MinHeap.
 - Developed algorithm based off "Dijsktra's shortest path algorithm"
       -Specifically from www.geeksfromgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-6-dijkstra-shortest-path-algorithm/
